santa, different wearning way

vase:
different position, situation

--change action (data aug failed)
dog:
beach

--subject/object fidelity
kept in aug, minimize the influence of loss, no clear influence on performance (originally want to use l2 to balance the tradeoff between prompt fidelity and class fidelity, but l2 failed, but the result from experiment shows no clear influence

(Creative Art and Design: Text-to-image generation techniques have been explored for generating artistic or creative visuals based on textual prompts. Artists and designers can leverage these techniques to explore new ideas, generate concept art, or assist in the creative process.)
-> style transfer, artistic work

Comparison-realistic/prompt fidelity
dog:
snow
jungle, unrealistic
city

Comparison-position, the subject's diversity, including position, action
dog:
snow
jungle, unrealistic
city,



--failure cases
dog:
mountain, the dog change

vase:
effiel towerl, recognize, generate effiel, but just 'add', the real surrounding of effiel is wrong, -> positional misundertanding

------------------


better prompt control, subject action can be different, 

the background, i.e., the requirement background from the prompt is more realistic

failure case: focus on subject fidelity
